# React: Data Structures Project
The main purpose of the project is present four data structures (Doubly Linked List, Hash Table, Static Queue and Heap) to the user in a easy way, through animations and simulations.
The project was developed as an college project to Data Structure (react web application) and Mobile Programming (react native application) of Computer Science course.

## Execution
You have to install node.js (and create-react-app or create-react-native-app packages) and the project required dependencies (available in package.json)

## Multiplatform content
Since we've developed the application using both React js libs (Web and Native), you can run our app everywhere, in your PC or cellphone!
